# skom
(name comes from a pun between the server software (minestom, which itself is a pun of 'minecraft-custom') and simple-kit-map)

this is the next-gen repo for SKM, preceding project includes score (simple-core) a Bukkit plugin for Paper 1.21+, and before that was llegacy Bukkit (1.7.10) essentialskiller and kitmanager (see organization repos)

super early bird info for README info for the lurkers (DM me on Discord if you read this :P)
* uses redis as a standalone database through jedis
* go read the minestom.net's docs if you don't know what that is
